   * a) configured Graphviz as an output
   * b) have specified SVG output file for Graphviz
   * c) have configured a custom DPI value for Graphviz

   *
   * ```properties
   * modular.graphviz.adjustSvgViewBox=true

   * Disabled by default.

   * If you don't want this adjustment to happen at all, you can suppress the Gradle warning with the following in

   * modular.graphviz.suppressAdjustSvgViewBox=true
