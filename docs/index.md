Atlas is a Gradle plugin for auto-generating and curating diagrams of your project's module structure.

## Key benefits:

   1. Fully supports Gradle 9 and the configuration cache.
   2. Offers wide-ranging APIs for customizing your module charts.
   3. Supports three separate charting frameworks as outputs:
      - [**Graphviz**](https://graphviz.org/)
      - [**D2**](https://d2lang.com/)
      - [**Mermaid**](https://mermaid.js.org/)

    This was built as a spiritial successor to [com.vanniktech.dependency.graph.generator](https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-dependency-graph-generator-plugin) project - but with more configurability and targeting modern Gradle releases.
