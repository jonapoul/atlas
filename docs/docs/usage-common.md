# Common Config

## Overview

Configuration is primarily done via the `atlas` Gradle extension function, accessible in your root build file. [See here for the KDoc](api/atlas-core/atlas.core/-atlas-extension/index.html), or [here for the source file](https://github.com/jonapoul/atlas-gradle-plugin/blob/main/atlas-core/src/main/kotlin/atlas/core/AtlasExtension.kt).

``` kotlin
// none of these are required - these values are the defaults
atlas {
  alsoTraverseUpwards = false
  checkOutputs = true
  displayLinkLabels = false
  generateOnSync = false
  groupProjects = false
  ignoredConfigs = setOf("debug", "kover", "ksp", "test")
  ignoredProjects = emptySet<String>()
  printFilesToConsole = false

  projectTypes {
    // ...
  }

  linkTypes {
    // ...
  }

  pathTransforms {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Alternatively, if calling from a `buildSrc` Kotlin file (or similar):

``` kotlin
project.extensions.configure<AtlasExtension> {
  // ...
}
```

Any other configs beyond these are specific to the particular plugin you applied, see:

- [Graphviz](usage-graphviz.md)
- [D2](usage-d2.md)
- [Mermaid](usage-mermaid.md)

## Limitations

### Configuration on demand

!!! warning

    If you have `org.gradle.configureondemand=true` enabled in your `gradle.properties`, you must run `atlasGenerate` and `atlasCheck` from the root project only. Running them on a specific subproject (e.g., `gradle :project:atlasGenerate`) will fail with an error or skip the check with a warning.

When [Gradle's configuration on demand](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_configuration_and_execution.html#sec:configuration_on_demand) feature is enabled, Atlas will generally work but it will restrict the `atlasGenerate` and `atlasCheck` tasks to be executed ONLY on the root project. This is because configuration-on-demand doesn't guarantee all that projects are configured when checking dependencies between them, which will lead to incomplete charts. Calling `atlasGenerate` on the root forces all dependencies to be resolved and passed correctly into the chart generation tasks.

Examples below with `org.gradle.configureondemand=true` set in `gradle.properties`.

**:white_check_mark: What works:**

Running on the root project:

``` shell
gradle atlasGenerate
gradle atlasCheck
```

These will execute every single generation/checking task in the entire Gradle build. That we we're ensuring that all configurations are being covered for inter-project dependencies.

**:x: What doesn't work:**

Running directly on a subproject:

``` shell
gradle :path:to:atlasGenerate
gradle :path:to:atlasCheck
```

These will both fail for the same reasons: they can't guarantee that the whole dependency tree will be included in the chart because projects uninvolved in the task execution will not be queried for their dependencies as part of the chart generation/checking.

If you want to generate diagrams for a specific project, your options are to either:

1. disable `org.gradle.configureondemand`, or
2. run `gradle atlasGenerate` on the root project, meaning all generation tasks are executed. This doesn't mean everything is run from scratch - any unchanged diagrams will be pulled from cache.

So far as I'm aware, there are no easy ways around this in modern Gradle.

## Properties

### alsoTraverseUpwards

``` kotlin
atlas {
  alsoTraverseUpwards = true
}
```

If enabled, the generated project graph will also go "upwards" (showing projects depending on this one) as well as the default "downwards" (projects being consumed by this one).

Examples below from the perspective of `:android:lib`:

<div class="side-by-side">
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Disabled</figcaption>
    <img src="../img/alsoTraverseUpwards-disabled.svg" alt="Disabled">
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Enabled</figcaption>
    <img src="../img/alsoTraverseUpwards-enabled.svg" alt="Enabled">
  </figure>
</div>

### checkOutputs

``` kotlin
atlas {
  checkOutputs = true
}
```

If enabled, a diffing task will be attached to `gradle check`. It will verify that your generated charts match the current state of the project layout, failing if not with a useful error message. Enabled by default.

The generated task name will depend on your chosen framework (`D2`, `Mermaid` or `Graphviz`) and the file type that you're checking (`Chart` or `Legend`), e.g. `checkD2Chart` or `checkGraphvizLegend`.

Even if this option is disabled, the task will still be created, it just won't be attached to `gradle check`.

### displayLinkLabels

``` kotlin
atlas {
  displayLinkLabels = true

  linkTypes {
    api(style = LinkStyle.Bold, displayName = "API")
    implementation(LinkStyle.Dashed, color = "red")
  }
}
```

When enabled, a string label is attached on each project link, showing which configuration caused represents the link. When true, the `LinkTypeSpec.name` property will be used. Disabled by default.

Requires some `linkTypes` to be declared - otherwise this will have no effect.

<div class="side-by-side">
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Disabled</figcaption>
    <img src="../img/displayLinkLabels-disabled.svg" alt="Disabled">
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Enabled</figcaption>
    <img src="../img/displayLinkLabels-enabled.svg" alt="Enabled">
  </figure>
</div>

### generateOnSync

``` kotlin
atlas {
  generateOnSync = true
}
```

When enabled, syncing your IntelliJ IDE (including Android Studio) will automatically trigger regeneration of your project diagrams. Disabled by default.

!!! danger

    Be careful enabling this on larger projects - sync time might extend quite a bit.

### groupProjects

``` kotlin
atlas {
  groupProjects = true
}
```

Set to true if you want project charts to gather together groups of projects into bordered containers. E.g. a graph with `":a"`, `":b"` and `":c"` won't be grouped at all because they don't share any path segments, but `":a:b"` and `"a:c"` will be grouped together. Disabled by default.

!!! tip

    Remember this will have no effect if your projects aren't nested at all.

!!! warning

    Automatic layout generation will get a bit complicated for larger projects when using grouping.

<div class="side-by-side">
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Disabled</figcaption>
    <img src="../img/groupProjects-disabled.svg" alt="Disabled">
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Enabled</figcaption>
    <img src="../img/groupProjects-enabled.svg" alt="Enabled">
  </figure>
</div>

### ignoredConfigs

``` kotlin
atlas {
  ignoredConfigs = setOf("debug", "kover", "ksp", "test")
}
```

Use this to configure Gradle `Configuration`s to ignore when collating project diagrams. Gradle does have a load of configurations floating around (depending on your project) - most of which will be practically useless when generating a diagram like this.

Defaults to `setOf("debug", "kover", "ksp", "test")`.

!!! tip "Remember"

    If you don't ignore any configurations, you might end up with double links between projects - or broken builds

### ignoredProjects

``` kotlin
atlas {
  ignoredProjects = setOf(
    ":path:to:some:project",
    ".*:test:.*", // uses regex patterns
  )
}
```

Defaults to an empty set.

### printFilesToConsole

``` kotlin
atlas {
  printFilesToConsole = true
}
```

Set to true to print the absolute path of any generated files to the Gradle console output. You can use this to help with scripting, if you like.

Disabled by default.

## Functions

### projectTypes

Use the `projectTypes` block to identify project categories, along with the styling to apply to each one in the output chart. These stylings will depend on your choice of plugin (see their docs for details), but at a minimum, each with support setting:

- **label** string
- **color**, as a CSS color string (`"chartreuse"`) or hex string (`"#7FFF00"`)
- **matcher**, used to decide whether a given project should match this type:
    - **pathContains** - checks whether the project path (`":projects:path:to:my:project"`) contains a given string. Case sensitive.
    - **patchMatches** - same as `pathContains`, but uses Regex pattern matching. You can also pass a `regexOptions` parameter to configure this more specifically, if you need.
    - **hasPluginId** - checks whether the project has applied the given plugin ID string, e.g. `com.android.application` or `org.jebtrains.kotlin.jvm`.

  Only one of these three project matchers should be specified.

Sample usage:

``` kotlin
atlas {
  projectTypes {
    hasPluginId(
      name = "UI",
      color = "#ABC123",
      pluginId = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose",
    )

    pathMatches(
      name = "Data",
      color = "#ABCDEF",
      pathMatches = ".*data$".toRegex(),
    )

    pathContains(name = "Domain", pathContains = "domain") {
      // some custom config can go as a trailing lambda
      // the available options here depends on the plugin variant
    }
  }
}
```

A few project type quick-access functions are built into Atlas for use in the projectTypes block if you need them:

``` kotlin
atlas {
  projectTypes {
    androidApp()
    androidLib()
    java()
    kotlinJvm()
    kotlinMultiplatform()
    other()

    // or useDefaults() to quickly add all of the above
  }
}
```

!!! warning

    Remember that the order of declaring project types does matter! When identifying a project, Atlas will use the first one and go down the list until it finds a match.

The below example shows one project of each of the built-in project types in a sample D2 project layout:

<img class="rounded-corner" src="../img/project-types-default.png" alt="Default project types">

Remember also that you can pass framework-specific configuration options into any project type declarations used above, with a trailing lambda. Example below comes from D2:

``` kotlin
atlas {
  projectTypes {
    androidApp {
      shape = Shape.Hexagon
      strokeWidth = 10
    }

    kotlinMultiplatform()

    androidLibrary {
      fontColor = "red"
    }
  }
}
```

### linkTypes

Use this block to configure categories of link to be detected in your project and drawn onto the projects chart. These are detected by Gradle's configuration names. In most cases you'll probably use `api` and `implementation` as your main link types, so these are available as quick-access config functions:

``` kotlin
atlas {
  linkTypes {
    implementation(color = "red")

    api(style = LinkStyle.Bold) {
      // custom config here - plugin-specific
    }
  }
}
```

!!! tip

    The `style` parameter on each of these will have different available options for each plugin. See the `LinkStyle` enum implementations for each one:

      - **Graphviz**: Bold, Dashed, Dotted, Invis, Solid, Tapered. [See here for details - specifically for "edges"](https://graphviz.org/docs/attr-types/style/)
      - **Mermaid**: Basic, Bold, Dashed, Invisible. [See here for details](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html#links-between-nodes)
      - **D2**: Basic, Bold, Dashed, Dotted, Invisible. [See here for details](https://d2lang.com/tour/connections/)

Besides the default `api` and `implementation`, you can declare links representing other Gradle configurations too:

``` kotlin
atlas {
  linkTypes {
    // All parameters are optional
    "compileOnly"(
      style = LinkStyle.Dotted,
      color = "#ABC123",
      displayName = "Compile-Only",
    )
  }
}
```

!!! warning

    As with project types, remember that the order of declaration matters! Top takes priority. So if you define "implementation" before "testImplementation", you won't get any links matching the latter because they all also match the former.

### pathTransforms

This is a little API for modifying project paths when inserting them into any generated diagrams. For example if your projects are all within a `"projects"` directory in your project's root, you might want to call something like:

``` kotlin
atlas {
  pathTransforms {
    // ":projects:path:to:something" => "path:to:something"
    remove("^:projects:")

    // "path:to:something" => "path to something"
    replace(":", replacement = " ")
  }
}
```

Remember the declarations inside `pathTransforms` are called in descending order. It does not support regex group replacement (yet?) - regex is only used for pattern matching.

## Extra properties

Several components in Atlas make use of the [`PropertiesSpec`](api/atlas-core/atlas.core/-properties-spec/index.html?query=interface%20PropertiesSpec) interface, which allows you to apply arbitrary key-value pair properties to the interfaces that make use of it. Specifically, you can call `put("key", value)`.

The intention with this is to let you pass in anything to the scope in question - allowing you to make use of any new APIs in that framework which haven't been explicitly implemented in Atlas. Any usage of these keys is up to you to validate - sometimes the diagram framework won't give you a warning if you pass in an invalid key. If you have some brand-spanking new attribute that you want to apply somewhere:

``` kotlin
atlas {
  projectTypes {
    // no custom config necessary
    androidApp()

    // but if you want to, use a trailing lambda:
    hasPluginId("Custom", pluginId = "com.custom.plugin") {
      // built-in setters for some known properties, depending on the context
      fill = "red"
      render3D = true
    }

    // standard colors/styles in the brackets, everything else in the lambda
    java(color = "orange") {
      // or custom setters for undefined properties
      put("insertKeyHere", "some-value")
    }
  }

  linkTypes {
    // no custom config necessary
    api()

    // again with the trailing lambda:
    implementation {
      animated = true
      strokeWidth = 100
    }
  }

  d2 {
    layoutEngine {
      elk {
        algorithm = ElkAlgorithm.Layered
        put("anotherElkProperty", 420)
      }
    }

    rootStyle {
      strokeDash = 5
      doubleBorder = true
      put("somenewbool", true)
      put("somenewint", 123)
      put("somenewstring", "yes")
    }
  }
}
```

These examples are not exhaustive - you can do the same with many components in Mermand and Graphviz too. If you're using some API for customising styles - have a look at the API spec for that class to see what else is available.
